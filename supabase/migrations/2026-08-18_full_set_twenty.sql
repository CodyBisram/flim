-- ============================================================
-- Migration: full_set becomes twenty other badges, not ten.
-- Paste into Supabase Dashboard -> SQL Editor and run. Safe to re-run.
--
-- ⚠️ ORDER: run AFTER 2026-08-18_good_company_ten.sql, already applied.
--
-- WHY
-- ----
-- A fixed count gets EASIER every time the catalogue grows, which is the one
-- way this ladder can quietly inflate. Adding seven badges in a single day took
-- full_set from 3 holders to 9 without anyone doing anything at all. Ten of
-- twenty-nine is a third of the catalogue; that is not a capstone.
--
-- Twenty is 80% of the twenty-five a normal account can actually obtain: of the
-- twenty-eight badges other than full_set itself, founder and founding_crew are
-- given by hand and founding_100's window is shut, so twenty-five is the real
-- ceiling for anyone who arrived after the hundredth signup. Measured against
-- the live distribution, twenty lands on exactly one account today, fifteen on
-- three, twelve on five.
--
-- ⚠️ THIS FILE DELETES EARNED ROWS. Same reasoning as good_company, and the
-- same narrow conditions: every full_set row in production was written today by
-- a backfill rather than by anything a person did, and all of them are marked
-- seen, so nobody was ever notified. Left in place they would mean nine
-- accounts hold a gold capstone for having ten badges under a rule that asks
-- for twenty, which is precisely the incoherence this change exists to remove.
-- PART 3 re-grants it to everyone who genuinely clears twenty.
